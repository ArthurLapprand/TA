Feature: Register Student
  As a professor
  I want to register students in the system
  So I can evaluate the students with respect to various criteria

#Cen치rio Controler
  Scenario: Register a new student
    Given the student "Roberto Alves" with login "ra" is not registered in the system
    When I register "Roberto Alves" with login "ra"
    Then the student "Roberto Alves" with login "ra" is registered in the system

#Cen치rio GUI
  Scenario: Message from the new student registration
    Given I am in the add student page
